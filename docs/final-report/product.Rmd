Our final data product consists of two elements. The first element is the python package, `EMGdecomPy`, and its associated [GitHub repository] containing the replicated @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016 blind-source separation algorithm. The second element is a Jupyter notebook containing a workflow leading up to an interactive dashboard visualizing the decomposition results. 

Creating a python package allows anyone who would like to decompose EMG signals into constituent motor units to simply download the package off of pip and run the `decomposition` function with the desired hyper-parameters on their data. Using a python package to deliver our blind-source separation algorithm not only increases accessibility but also readability of the code by breaking the blind-source separation algorithm into many different functions with informative docstrings. By giving the partner access to the GitHub repository for `EMGdecomPy` we allow them to view the source code and even edit it if they desire to add more functionality in the future. These attributes of our data product satisfy the partner's desires to replicate the blind-source separation algorithm from @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016 without experimental duration limits, while providing them with easy-to-understand open source code which means they will understand how their experimental results are derived.

The Jupyter notebook provides the partner with an interface in which to use `EMGdecomPy`. This notebook further facilitates our package's ease-of-use, as loading in the data, running the algorithm, and visualizing the data, will be laid out in a step-by-step process. Essentially, the Jupyter notebook will eliminate all confusion in how to use the package, and can be re-used to analyze different data, or to change hyper-parameters.
