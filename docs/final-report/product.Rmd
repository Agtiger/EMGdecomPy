Our final data product consists of two elements. The first element is the Python package, `EMGdecomPy`, and its associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Motor-Unit/EMGdecomPy) containing the replicated @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016 blind source separation algorithm. The second element is a Jupyter notebook containing a workflow leading up to an interactive dashboard visualizing the decomposition results. 

Creating a Python package allows anyone who would like to decompose EMG signals into constituent motor units to simply download the package off of `pip` and run the `decomposition` function with the desired hyper-parameters on their data. Using a Python package to deliver our blind source separation algorithm not only increases accessibility but also the readability of the code by breaking the blind source separation algorithm into many different functions with informative docstrings. By giving the partner access to the GitHub repository for `EMGdecomPy`, we allow them to view the source code and even edit it if they desire to add more functionality in the future. These attributes of our data product satisfy the partner's desires to replicate the blind source separation algorithm from @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016 without experimental duration limits, while providing them with easy-to-understand open-source code, allowing them to understand how their experimental results are derived.

```

The Jupyter notebook provides the partner with an interface in which to use `EMGdecomPy`. This notebook further facilitates our package's ease of use, as loading the data, running the algorithm, and visualizing the results, will be laid out in a reproducible step-by-step process. The GUI of the interactive dashboard provided in this notebook can be seen in **figure \@ref(fig:emgdecompy-gui)**.

As mentioned above, we have not had the chance to thoroughly validate our algorithm. However, preliminary results look promising, as 3 out of 5 of the MUAP shapes identified by `EMGdecomPy` were also identified by @Hug2021 for the *Gastrocnemius lateralis* muscle with 10% contraction intensity.
