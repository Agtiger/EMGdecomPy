*The sensorimotor system*, or the bodily process that links physical movement to outside sensory information, is a key component of human motion [@forbes_little_candow_2012]. A healthy sensorimotor system is critical, as it is required to communicate, interact, and navigate through one's environment. Muscle movement, a key component of motion and the motor system's purpose, is the carefully coordinated result between the nervous and muscular systems.

The Sensorimotor Physiology Lab at the UBC School of Kinesiology studies the nervous system's role in muscle movement. Dr. Jean-Sébastien Blouin's research is targeted at understanding the sensorimotor system's role in human balance, as well as expanding on the known neurological-muscular mechanisms involved in human motion. By studying the link between the nervous system and movement, researchers can further understand the effects of neuromuscular damage. Findings can be used to establish preventative measures, as well as to create more effective therapeutic treatments for those with chronic neuromuscular disorders and age-related neural degeneration [@purves_2018].

The brain, spinal cord, and attached nerves form the nervous system, which is responsible for initiating and propagating electrical movement signals to the correct muscles. These electrical bursts, known as action potential, are initially fired off from the brain. Action potential propagates throughout the body via neurons, which are cells specialized in transmitting electrical signals across long distances.

Motor neurons are a specific subclass of neurons that create a junction between the central nervous system and the muscular system. Motor neurons attach to fibers in the muscle, forming an entity known as a motor unit, as seen in **figure \@ref(fig:motor-unit)**. When struck by action potential, the motor unit generates motor unit action potential (MUAP), a burst of electrical activity specific to the motor unit that produced it. The MUAP signal causes the muscle fibers attached to the motor unit to contract [@purves_2018].

The activation of several motor units (and their accompanying MUAPs) are required to move a single muscle. Therefore, the number of motor units involved in an isolated muscle movement can be determined by measuring the net electrical charge of a single muscle.

The partner uses non-invasive electromyography (EMG) to measure the net firing of MUAPs across a single muscle, seen in **figure \@ref(fig:emg-hardware)a** as opposed to invasive EMG, seen **figure \@ref(fig:emg-hardware)b**. Surface electrodes are placed on the skin and voltage is measured as participants flex and relax a muscle. The partner uses a grid of 64 surface electrodes, as seen in **figure \@ref(fig:EMG-ex)**, allowing the collection of 64 streams of MUAP data across a single muscle. The raw signal collected by EMG is the result of many MUAP peaks constructively and destructively interfering with each other.

(ref:emg-hardware) Obtaining EMG with a. surface electrodes and b. needle electrodes. Invasive EMG using needle electrodes is the more commonly used technique, as it allows access to deeper muscle groups and higher muscle region selectivity which decreases noise. In comparison, non-invasive EMG using surface electrodes are less selective and can only sample superficial muscles, as they sit on the skin far away from the muscle fibres [@emg_decomposition_tutorial]. Non-invasive EMG is also a more flexible and easier-to-apply technique with higher long-term stability than invasive EMG, which are desirable attributes to the partner [@farina_holobar_2015].

A blind source separation algorithm can decompose raw EMG signals into several individual electrical signals that can be ascribed to singular muscle units. The partner currently decomposes EMG signals using a free software from @ot_bioelettronica called `OTBioLab+`. This software's graphical user interface (GUI) can be seen in **figure \@ref(fig:OTBioelettronica-GUI)**. `OTBioLab+` determines the individual MUAP spike trains using a closed-source algorithm based off a paper published by @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016.

The decomposition of EMG signals is a critical technique for the partner's research. Decomposition allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of which motor units are responsible for which parts of movement in a muscle. As is, `OTBioLab+` is an unideal solution for decomposing EMG signals for the partner's needs.

The creation of a custom Python package, `EMGdecomPy`, can address the issues with `OTBioLab+`, and contains custom functionalities specific to the partner’s use. `OTBioLab+` is closed-source, which obscures how the partner's experimental results are derived. By making  `EMGdecomPy` open-source,  the algorithm’s code can be easily inspected, circumventing this problem. Additionally, `OTBioLab+` also has a 100 second time limit on experiments, which hinders the partner as they run experiments up to 5 minutes in length. In `EMGdecomPy`, there is no hard-coded time limit on experiments that can be run.

The transparency of `EMGdecomPy`'s code and the open-source licensing supports other parties expanding on and improving the existing functionalities. While made for the partner, it is our hope that `EMGdecomPy` will be a useful package for other researchers to explore the mechanisms underlying the brain's interactions with the body's muscles.
