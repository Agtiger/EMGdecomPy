The decomposition of EMG signals into individual motor units is a critical technique for understanding the relationship between the nervous and muscular systems. The UBC Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory’s research currently decomposes raw EMG signals using a free software from OT Bioelettronica, whose code is based on a paper from @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016. As this software has several shortcomings, we have replicated the decomposition algorithm and packaged it in an open-source Python package called `EMGdecomPy`, over the course of the capstone project. Additionally, we have included a reproducible tool to visualize the decomposed output of the algorithm. 

The decomposition algorithm described by @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016 was broken up into individual functions. These functions were individually tested and extensively documented for the sake of transparency. Finally, per the partner’s request, `EMGdecomPy` was made flexible enough to run experiments of an arbitrary. Preliminary qualitative results show that `EMGdecomPy` identifies 3 out of 5 of the same motor units as @Hug2021 when run on their raw EMG data obtained from the *Gastrocnemius lateralis* muscle with 10% contraction intensity.

While the sequential steps to decompose raw EMG signals were given by @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016, there was room for interpretation and improvement in the implementation of each step. Future recommendations for improvement include, decreasing the algorithm's run-time through optimization, increasing decomposition accuracy through domain knowledge, and implementing a relearning feature into the algorithm.
