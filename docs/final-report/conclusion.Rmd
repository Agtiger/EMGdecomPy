Muscle movement is generated when the brain sends electrical activity known as action potentials to an MU. The MU fires a form of action potential called a MUAP, which causes the attached muscle fibres to contract. A technique known as EMG uses electrodes to measure the electrical activity across a single muscle. The raw EMG signal is the combination of many MUAPs and can be decomposed using a blind source separation algorithm into separate electrical signals that correspond to different MUs.

Our final data product presented is an open-source Python package, `EMGdecomPy`, containing two elements. The first element is an algorithm based on work by @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016. The algorithm was developed using data from @Hug2021. The second component is a Jupyter notebook that provides a template for users to interactively view the decomposed output of the algorithm. 

Although `EMGdecomPy` has not been thoroughly validated yet, preliminary qualitative results show that the package identifies 3 out of 5 of the same motor units as the commercial `DEMUSE` software when run on the same *Gastrocnemius lateralis* muscle with 10% contraction intensity data obtained from @Hug2021. Recommendations for future work include expanding the qualitative validation to other muscle groups and contraction intensities provided by @Hug2021 and performing quantitative analysis using the RoA metric, as well as increasing the softwareâ€™s accuracy through domain knowledge and implementing the re-learning feature.
