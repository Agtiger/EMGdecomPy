Muscle movement is the result of coordination between the bodyâ€™s nervous and muscular system. To move a muscle, the brain releases action potential, a short burst of electrical activity. Action potential propagates via the nervous system, triggering a motor unit. The motor unit generates a specific type of action potential, known as motor unit action potential (MUAP), which causes the attached muscle fibers to contract. 

A technique known as electromyography (EMG), uses electrodes to measure the electrical activity across a single muscle. The raw signal is the result of many motor unit action potential peaks constructively and destructively interfering with each other.  A blind source separation algorithm, as described by @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016, can decompose raw EMG signals into several individual electrical signals that can be ascribed to singular muscle units.

Our final data product presented is an open-source Python package, `EMGdecomPy`, containing two main elements. The first component is the reconstructed decomposition algorithm as described in the pseudocode of @negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016. The algorithm has been slightly adjusted and validated using data from @Hug2021. The second component is a Jupyter notebook that provides a template for users to interactively view the decomposed output of the algorithm. 

`EMGdecomPy` hasn't been thoroughly validated yet, but preliminary qualitative results show that the package identifies 3 out of 5 of the same motor units as the DEMUSE software when run on the same *Gastrocnemius lateralis* muscle with 10% contraction intensity data obtained from @Hug2021. Future work includes expanding the qualitative validation to other muscle groups and contraction intensities provided by @Hug2021, and performing quantitative analysis using the rate of agreement.
