## Introduction

*Motor commands*, or the coordinated actions between the brain and nervous system, enable the muscular movement of daily life. As the human body ages or suffers from neuromuscular disorders, the brain’s motor commands degenerate, leading to difficulty in mobility and communication. Thus, it is imperative to study motor commands and the neural system that facilitates movement in our bodies. In this proposal, we aim to create a Python package that decomposes and visualizes the electrical signals sent from our brains to various muscles.

Electromyography (EMG) is used to quantify the net electrical charge of a muscle as it contracts. In non-invasive electromyography, surface electrodes are placed on the skin and voltage is measured as participants flex and relax a muscle. The collected signal is the sum of all the electric action potential fired from neurons attached to a muscle fiber. A single muscle fiber, along with its connected motor neurons, is known as a motor unit. Typically, researchers are interested in discovering when and which motor unit contributed to the net EMG signal. 

Currently, the Sensorimotor Physiology Lab at UBC School of Kinesiology decomposes EMG signals using a free software from OT Bioelettronica, which parses the individual action potential spike trains using a closed-source algorithm. This type of decomposition is known as a convolutive blind source separation algorithm and is based off a paper published by Negro, et al (2016), which provides the mathematical logic and pseudocode used to build the algorithm. The algorithm employs high-level linear algebra and unsupervised learning techniques, such as Latent Component and K-Means classification.

The goal for this project is to recreate the blind-source separation algorithm described in Negro, et al (2016). Additionally, we hope to create a visualization tool that allows users to view the deconstructed EMG signals. To fit the needs of the Sensorimotor Physiology Lab, we will modify the program to deconstruct EMG recordings up to 5 minutes in length. Currently, the Bioelettronica software limits EMG decomposition to 100 second long recordings.   

The final data product we will deliver is a Python package, emg-decomPy, that contains the decomposition algorithm and the visualization tool. We aim for emg-decomPy to be open-source and transparent, so future parties can customize or further develop functionalities. To accomplish this, there will be a large emphasis on documentation throughout the development of the package. While made for the Sensorimotor Physiology Lab, it is our hope that emg-decomPy will be a useful package to broadly explore the mechanisms underlying the brain’s interactions with our muscles.
