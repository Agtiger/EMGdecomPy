*Motor commands*, or the coordinated actions between the brain and nervous system, enable the muscular movement of daily life. As the human body ages or suffers from neuromuscular disorders, the brain’s motor commands degenerate, leading to difficulty in mobility and communication. Thus, it is imperative to study motor commands and the neural system that facilitates movement in our bodies. In this proposal, we aim to create a Python package that decomposes and visualizes the electrical signals sent from our brains to various muscles.

Electromyography (EMG) is used to quantify the net electrical charge of a muscle as it contracts. In non-invasive electromyography, surface electrodes are placed on the skin, as seen in the diagram in figure \@ref(fig:emg-hardware), and voltage is measured as participants flex and relax a muscle.

```

The collected signal is the sum of all the electric action potentials fired from motor neurons attached to muscle fiber [@negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016]. A motor neuron, along with its connected muscle fibres, is known as a motor unit [@purves_2018]. Decomposing the net EMG signal into the contributions of each individual motor unit, the process of which can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:emg-decomposition), provides crucial information in research areas such as motor neuron discharge behaviour and muscle architecture, which deepen our understanding of the human body and can be used in diagnosing muscular disorders [@mcgill_lateva_marateb_2005][@emg_decomposition_tutorial].

Currently, the Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory decomposes EMG signals using a free software from OT Bioelettronica, the graphical user interface (GUI) of which can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:OTBioelettronica-GUI). This software determines the individual motor unit action potential spike trains using a closed-source algorithm. This type of decomposition is known as a convolutive blind source separation algorithm and is based off a paper published by Negro et al (2016), which provides the mathematical logic and pseudocode used to build the algorithm. The algorithm employs high-level linear algebra and unsupervised learning techniques, such as Latent Component Analysis and K-Means classification.

The goal for this project is to recreate the blind-source separation algorithm described in Negro et al (2016). Additionally, we hope to create a simple non-interactive visualization tool that allows users to view the deconstructed EMG signals. To fit the needs of the Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory, we will modify the program to decompose EMG recordings of up to 5 minutes in length. Presently, the Bioelettronica software limits EMG decomposition to 100 second long recordings.

The final data product is a Python package, `EMGdecomPy`, that contains the decomposition algorithm and the visualization tool. We aim for `EMGdecomPy` to be open-source and transparent, so future parties can customize or further develop functionalities. To accomplish this, there will be a large emphasis on documentation throughout the development of the package. While made for the Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory, it is our hope that `EMGdecomPy` will be a useful package to broadly explore the mechanisms underlying the brain’s interactions with our muscles.
