Muscle movement is facilitated via the nervous system, which transports action potentials (electrical signals) from the brain to motor units. The motor units pass these electrical pulses through a motor neuron attached to muscle fibers, causing the muscle to contract [@purves_2018]. The net electrical charge of a muscle can be measured via electromyography, or EMG. EMG signals can then be decomposed into several individual electrical signals that can be ascribed to singular muscle units [@negro_muceli_castronovo_holobar_farina_2016].

In this proposal, we attempt to recreate and improve the blind-source separation algorithm created by Negro et al. (2016) that decomposes action potential spike trains from EMG signals. Currently, the blind source algorithm identifies individual motor unit action potential peaks and their firing times within an experimental duration limit of 100 seconds. Incorrectly identified peaks are then manually removed post hoc. Ideally, experiments of up to 5 minutes would be able to be processed by the algorithm. Instead of manually removing all false positives, ideally the user would be able to remove these false positives from an early sample of the decomposition from which the algorithm would learn to avoid these mistakes in the rest of the decomposition.

The final product proposed is a Python package with two main components. The first component is the reconstructed decomposition algorithm, optimized for the Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory's use case. The second component is a non-interactive visualization element that allows users to view the decomposed output of the algorithm.
