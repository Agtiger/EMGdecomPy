There are two primary goals we identified within this project. The
techniques and tools in this proposal are based on these two components: 

1. Build custom software that inputs the raw signals *(see figure \@ref(fig:emg-signal-example))* provided by the surface 
electrode and outputs the decomposed data.

2. Create a tool to visualize the decomposed signals.


```{r emg-signal-example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "A raw EMG signal prior to decomposition.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/raw_EMG.png")
```

### Stretch Goals

We have stretch goals contingent on completing the primary goals in
time. 

1. Provide a GUI in the visualization tool for manually 
marking false positives. False positives, in the context of the EMG data, are 
action potential peaks incorrectly identified by the decomposition algorithm. 
The GUI would allow users to mark a false positive signal on the
decomposed graph, removing it from the visualization and the decomposed
data. 

2. Analyze whether the software can be optimized based on the user's specific 
needs. As is, the decomposition algorithm is a robust, generalization solution 
that requires a lot of computational power. To cut down on computation time, we 
will see if any of the steps can be simplified, skipped, or reduced to better 
fit the specific needs of the Sensorimotor Physiology Laboratory.

3. If there is still time left in the project, we can begin to take steps
towards the "interactive learning" upgrade. This would allow users to mark
false positive observations from a sample of the beginning of the decomposition, allowing 
the algorithm to integrate this new information into the rest of the decomposition.

### Techniques and Tools

The primary tool described in the Negro et al. (2016) paper that our software will
utilize is the convolutive/iterative blind source separation
algorithm for the decomposition of EMG signals. This algorithm, in turn, is
based on the general decomposition framework and validation technique
presented in earlier works, including Holobar et al. (2010), Marateb et al. (2011), and Hu et al. (2014). The convolutive blind source separation technique is a combination of Latent Component Analysis (LCA) and iterative fixed-point K-Means classification. 

- LCA extracts meaningful features out of a large set of EMG signal observations to identify motor
unit activity potential discharges.

- K-Means performs classification on individual motor units.

We will use a combination of tools for development. 

- GitHub for collaborative version control of our package. 

- Jupyter notebooks for developing minor, intermediate steps. Additionally, 
the notebooks can be used as a sandbox to try out contained modules. 

- SageMaker Lab to build a virtual machine, which will solve two problems.

  1. The existing black-box software is Windows-only, and using SageMaker
VM will allow us to test our algorithm against the original.

  2. SageMaker will provide us with the computational power to run longer
sequences of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). 

We will ultimately provide our product in the python package, `EMGdecomPy`. To 
help us with the set-up and distribution of this package, we will use:

- `Cookiecutter`, package that sets up Python package boilerplate from 
a Python project template. 

- `Poetry`, a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. 

### Stretch Goals Techniques and Tools

Our project is primarily based on replicating the algorithm from the Negro et 
al. (2016) paper, so at this point we do not plan to attempt any other
techniques for decomposition. However, we may explore possible
alternative techniques if we get to the optimization stretch goal. One
possible technique to consider are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or bi-directional RNNs. 
RNNs are a type of neural network that retains "memory" between each learning 
step, making it a powerful tool for working with sequential data, such as time series.
