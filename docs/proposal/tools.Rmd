There are two primary goals we identified within this project, and the
techniques will be chosen based on those components.

1.  Build custom software that inputs the raw signals provided by the
    surface electrode and outputs the decomposed data
2.  Visualize the decomposed signals

We also have stretch goals contingent on completing the primary goals in
time. First stretch goal is to provide GUI for manually marking false
positives. This would include marking a false positive signal on the
decomposed graph, and removing it from the visualization and from the
raw data. At the same time, we will analyze whether the software can be
optimized software based on user's specific needs. To do so, we will
review whether anything within algorithm can be hardcoded, skipped,
vectorizes, simplified or limited in a way that improves performances.
If we still have time left in the project, we can begin to take steps
towards the "live learning" upgrade. This would allow the user to mark
false positive observations while the decomposition is running, allowing
the algorithm to learn in real time.

### Techniques and Tools in the original algorithm (Negro et al, 2016)

The primary tool described in Negro et al paper that our software till
utilize is Convolutive / iterative blind source separation proprietary
algorithm for decomposition optimization. This algorithm, in turn, is
based on the general decomposition framework and validation technique
presented in earlier works, including Holobar et al 2010, Marateb et al
2011a, and Hu et al 2014. Convolutive blind source separation technique
is a combination of latent component analysis (LCA) and iterative
fixed-point K-means classification technique. LCA extracts meaningful
features out of a large set of EMG signal observations to identify motor
unit activities, and K-Means performs classification into individual
motor units.

### Additional Techniques and Tools

Our project is primarily based on replicating the algorithm from Negro
et al paper, so at this point we do not plan to attempt any other
techniques for decomposition. However, we may explore possible
alternative techniques if we get to the optimization stretch goal. One
possible technique to consider is RNNs or bi-direction RNNs since we are
dealing with time series type data. We will also check if there were any
advances in machine learning techniques since the release of this
software to see if any of the new tools that haven't been considered at
the time of writing this paper and this algorithm, such as transformer
algorithms, can be useful.

We will use a combination of tools for the development setup. We will
use GitHub for collaborative version control of our package. We will
develop Jupyter notebooks for small intermediate steps and as sandbox to
try out contained modules. Once the algorithm has been built, we will
use virtual machine by SageMaker lab. This will solve two problems.
First, existing black-box software is Windows-only, and using SageMaker
VM will allow us to test our algorithm against the original.
Additionally, it will provide us with computational power to run longer
sequences of muscle unit action potentials (MUAPs.) We will ultimately
provide the solution in a python package emg-decomPy. The package will
be set up with cookie cutter and utilize poetry for dependency
management and configuration
