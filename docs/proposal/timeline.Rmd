The proposal was created over the course of the first week of the capstone project. During the partner meeting on Thursday May 12, 2022, Jean-Sebastian introduced the team to the repository he discovered where another developer replicated the algorithm from  Negro et al. (2016). The repository in question is not a python package but rather a simple set of functions without docstrings or testing mechanisms in place. Contingent on the response from the developer, the team will either build upon his existing code, or use it as an additional reference when writing functions for the steps of the algorithm. Regardless, the team agreed that this finding pushed the timeline up and made stretch goals more achievable. So while the primary objective remains to deliver an open-source python package replicating the algorithm, the tentative timeline has been sped up and now includes the stretch goals.

***Note***: Dates in this timeline are tentative as we are still defining the scope of the project:

**May 6, 2022**: Present the proposal presentation to colleagues and project mentor.<br />

**May 13, 2022**: Submit the finalized proposal to the capstone partner. <br />

**May 20, 2022**: Complete replicating the original algorithm and present it to the partner. <br />

**May 27, 2022**: Present visualization component to the partner. <br />

**June 1, 2022**: Make revisions to the algorithm and visualization based on last meeting. <br />

**June 3, 2022**: Propose changes to improve and optimize the original algorithm. <br />

**June 5, 2022**: Demo live update functionality. <br />

**June 10, 2022**: Implement proposed changes and optimizations. <br />

**June 14, 2022**: Final revisions to the original algorithm and new functionality. <br />

**June 17, 2022**: Final presentation. <br />

**June 29, 2022**: Submit data product and final report. <br />
